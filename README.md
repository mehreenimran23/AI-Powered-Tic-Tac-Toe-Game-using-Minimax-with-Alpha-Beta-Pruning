# AI-Powered-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-Minimax-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
This repository contains a complete implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game (3x3 grid) with an AI agent that uses the Minimax algorithm enhanced by Alpha-Beta Pruning to play optimally. This means the AI will never lose and will always choose the best possible move given the current state of the board.
