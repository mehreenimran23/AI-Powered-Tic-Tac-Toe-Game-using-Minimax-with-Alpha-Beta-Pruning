# AI-Powered-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-Minimax-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
This repository contains a complete implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game (3x3 grid) with an AI agent that uses the Minimax algorithm enhanced by Alpha-Beta Pruning to play optimally. This means the AI will never lose and will always choose the best possible move given the current state of the board.

üìù Problem Statement
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game played on a 3√ó3 grid. Players take turns marking the spaces with their respective symbols ‚Äî X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The goal of this project is to implement an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The AI must evaluate the game board and return the optimal move for the current player, ensuring a perfect strategy that never loses.

Game Rules
Two players: one uses X, the other uses O.
Players alternate turns.
The player who places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Functions Implemented
initial_state()
Initializes the empty 3x3 board.

player(board)
Returns whose turn it is ‚Äî either 'X' or 'O'.

actions(board)
Returns the set of valid moves available on the current board.

result(board, action)
Returns a new board state after making a given move.

winner(board)
Returns the winner, if there is one.

terminal(board)
Checks if the game is over.

utility(board)
Returns:

+1 if 'X' wins
-1 if 'O' wins
0 for a draw

alpha_beta_pruning(board)
Core function that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to return the best move for the current player.
